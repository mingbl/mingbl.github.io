Hi there! I'm Ming B. Leong. I'm a Chinese Australian full-stack developer, database manager, filmmaker, and graphics designer. I have over eight years of experience designing websites and developing software, and have recently completed a Bachelor of Information and Communications Technology from the University of the Sunshine Coast.

I have developed tools for content creation, social media utilities, an interactive scheduling application, and a presentation tool for the University of the Sunshine Coast's CAVE2 visualisation facility. I previously held a role as the leader of an independent screen media group creating digital content.
