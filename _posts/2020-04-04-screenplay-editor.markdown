Created for an online video production organisation to streamline the writing and execution of screenplay scripts.

Parses raw text input and converts into an interactive, formatted screenplay script through a script viewer component. Features text manipulation functionalities. Interprets scene and stage directions to determine styling and alignment.

The organisation used the 'machinima' technique to produce their videos, a process that necessiated efficiency in relaying dialogue virtually, directly from the scripts. This application solved this problem by enabling actors to copy their lines directly from the script by interacting with the screenplay viewer component; Clicking on their line would copy their specific dialogue to their clipboard, allowing them to quickly copy to the in-game chatbox during filming.

The 'Share Script' button appends the content of the script to the URL, allowing users to bookmark the script or share the script within the viewer.

Developed with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
